        <p> Special thanks to my chief editor and primary research assistant in aiding with this project. Ashley is a intersectional feminist and avid human rights activist with a focus on advocacy for education for women and girls, addressing situations of gender inequality and dismantling the widespread rape culture within our society.</p>
        <h3>An excerpt from one of her pieces of writing on rape culture:</h3>
        <i>"Sexual violence in the west is fundamentally a problem of masculinity - a manifestation of the phenomenon that gender studies conceptualizes as 'toxic masculinity." - Jeremy Posadas

toxic masculinity refers to the stereotypical, socially-constructed attitudes that describe the masculine gender role as violent, unemotional, and sexually aggressive.

Toxic masculinity places men into a box but what happens if they try to leave that box? They are shamed, persecuted, told that they are not manly enough, not aggressive, not dominant, told that they are not fit to be men because they clearly don't wear the pants. 


They are bludgeoned with comments like "Man up." "Men aren't supposed to cry." and "Stop acting like a girl." These statements, meant to "toughen" them up and give them "thicker skin" do the opposite.

They eat away at their self esteem and leave them with fragile egos, a thirst, and a longing to prove themselves as men. Which leads to what? Men trying to exert their dominance, trying to prove that they are worthy of the label man and sometimes this manifests itself in one of the most horrific crimes that can be committed against a woman: rape. 

Toxic masculinity, therefore, does not only affect men but women as well as it leads to a society where women are victimised and constantly have their rights violated and ignored by the men negatively affected by toxic masculinity within the society.</i>

      <p> Justin Magidan is a brave survivor of violence whom was willing to share his testimony for the benefit of this website.</p>
      <h3> His Testimony-</h3>
      <i> "For several years of my life I went through mental, physical and emotional abuse. It was a very hard time for me and I considered ending my life on many occasions but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I felt trapped and I didn’t know how to get out until my grandmother took me out of the situation and introduced me to God and the catholic church. From there my life took a turn for the better and I understood the amazing grace of God and how he used ordinary people to do fantastic things for him. I decided to use my story in order to help persons going through the same thing but are afraid to speak out. Through church I met my brother and his ministry Beautifully Broken." </i>
